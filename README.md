# About Me :

After 6 years of study to complete a master’s degree in physical education (5 years licence + master, and a year spent abroad in Québec), and one year working as a PE teacher in Parisian schools, I decided to pursue my passion for technology and undertake a professional retraining in the digital field to become a Web Developer. I completed an intense bootcamp with Le Reacteur, created my first MVP in a team, built on my knowledge with continuous self-learning. Those experiences allow me today to seek a position as Fullstack Developer.

I’m currently looking for an internship (6 month) or a permanent contract. I can start as soon as possible.

Motto is a vintage clothing sales application aiming at creating a fashion dictionary. The motto community is going to create the dictionary incrementally with their own ads for items of vintage clothing. With this application you can sell and buy clothing but you can also just post one of your most wonderful item to share it with the community and help build the dictionary. All of the items posted must be from before 2000 and are checked by the motto team before they appear on the application.

Frontend : signIn, signUp, see all the ads available, create, modify and delete an ad, buy an item, wallet, purchase history, modify your profile, fashion dictionary.

Backend : CRUD, Authentification, backoffice with forestAdmin (content administration), payment with stripe.

Repo : Private

# About Me :

After 6 years of study to complete a master’s degree in physical education (5 years licence + master, and a year spent abroad in Québec), and one year working as a PE teacher in Parisian schools, I decided to pursue my passion for technology and undertake a professional retraining in the digital field to become a Web Developer. I completed an intense bootcamp with Le Reacteur, created my first MVP in a team, built on my knowledge with continuous self-learning. Those experiences allow me today to seek a position as Fullstack Developer.

I’m currently looking for an internship (6 month) or a permanent contract. I can start as soon as possible.
